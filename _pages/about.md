Welcome to my website! My name is Zhaoqi Zhu (朱钊祺), but feel free to call me David! I am a second year Masters student in Mathematics at University of Pennsylvania. In general, I am interested in algebraic topology, especially equivariant stable homotopy theory and algebraic K-theory. Recently, I have also developed a growing interest in the interplay between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. My thesis advisor is [Mona Merling](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~mmerling/). 

In my free time, I enojoy working out and playing music. In particular, I like playing the guitar and spend a lot of time trying to convince other people that John Mayer is a great musician.
