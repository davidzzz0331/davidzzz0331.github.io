Welcome to my website! My name is Zhaoqi Zhu (朱钊祺), but feel free to call me David! I am a second year Master's student in Mathematics at University of Pennsylvania. In general, I am interested in algebraic topology, especially equivariant stable homotopy theory and algebraic K-theory. Recently, I have also developed a growing interest in the interplay between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. My thesis advisor is [Mona Merling](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~mmerling/). 

Here is a copy of my [CV](/assets/pdf/Zhaoqi_Zhu_CV Final.pdf).

In my free time, I enojoy working out and playing music. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy working out in the gym and playing music. I'm an avid guitarist, and I often find myself trying to convince others that John Mayer is, without a doubt, a fantastic musician.
