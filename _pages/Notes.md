# Notes and Writeups

Welcome to my collection of notes and writeups! Below you will find a list of topics I have explored, with short descriptions and links to the full writeups for each one.

### 1. **Notes for Equivariant (stable) Homotopy Theory**

*This is a in-progress set of notes I have taken while learning equivariant (stable) homotopy theory from various sources.*

### 2. **Notes for Algebraic K-theory**

*This is a in-progress set of notes I have taken while learning higher K-theory following the original papers and Weibel.*

### 3. **Course Notes on commutative algebra**

*This is a more-or-less polished set of notes for math 603, taught by Prof. Florian Pop in Spring 2024 at UPenn.*

### 4. **Short Notes on Serre Spectral Sequences and pi_4(S^3)**

*This is the set of notes I prepared on Serre spectral sequences for Math 601, taught by Prof. Mona Merling in Spring 2024 at UPenn.*
